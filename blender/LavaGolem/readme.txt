added some cams, lights and shadows to create a spritesheet

orginal found on

A fantasy character - lava golem, probably a child of some old volcano
which doesn't want to be disturbed by any visitor. Model is based on a
concept - http://www.render.ru/gallery/show_work.php?work_id=72971 so
many thanks to Boris. for his awesome artwork!

It is fully rigged and has three animations: idle, walk and attack

Unfortunately, textures I made are based on photos taken from
cgtextures.com so I can not provide you with them here on opengameart,
hence this .blend contains only glow map which is made totally by me.

ih has 5.5k tris and 4 2048x2048 maps(diff, normal, spec, glow)

 

you can check it on http://p3d.in/Q3wLh
