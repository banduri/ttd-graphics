* If you post a link, I prefer it to be to my personal website ( www.ranum.com )  My real name is Marcus Ranum please use that instead of "mjranum"

2) You are required to give me appropriate credit as photographer where and however possible.

5) If you want to do something commercial with my stock, go ahead. Please don't tell me "I am thinking of doing something with your stock, what do you think?" because I can't tell you what I think of what you're going to do until you've done it. Go ahead and use the stock; unless you manage to do something shockingly awful I won't have a problem with it - and it takes a lot to shock me.
